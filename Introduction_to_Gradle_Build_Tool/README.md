These are the exercises for the **Introduction to Gradle Build Tool**
training course. They are designed to give you hands-on experience
during the live training to get you going on your journey.

The exercises are progressive, each one building upon the previous. You can
continue to use the same workspace throughout the exercises. If you prefer
to use a different workspace for each one, there are Gradle projects provided
in the `lab` folders in each exercise.
